                        <p>Addiction has an impact on every member of a household not just the individual with the substance abuse problem. Unlike individual therapy, which addresses the thoughts, behaviours and attitudes of the person seeking treatment for drug or alcohol addiction, family therapy strives to treat a group or network of individuals who are affected by the addiction. We at Catalyst Initiative believe that addiction affects everyone and family therapy is an indispensable part of the treatment process.</p>

                        <p>Relapse is never an accident; it is a gradual break of defences which manifests first in thoughts and then behavioural elements where the extreme could be using the substance again. We at the Catalyst Initiative facilitate a very comprehensive Relapse Prevention Programme which helps clients evaluate their thoughts, feelings and actions to refocus their goal of a clean and sober life. </p>
